# WSUVTwitter

This is an implementation of Twitter front-end user interface. The app uses AFNetworking to connect to WSU-Vancouver server and send Restful HTTP GET/POST requests to carry out its functionalities such as retreiving tweets, posting a tweet or registering. It uses AFNetworking's JSON serializer to analyze the server response which is in JSON format. Passwords and session tokens are stored in SSKeyChain.
